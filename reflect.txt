To run the code, go to market.py. In the bottom half-

m = number of agents
n = number of goods
ue = 2D np.array of utility functions' exponent. Each row for each agent. So it should be of shape (m,n)
endw = 2D np.array of initial endownments. Each row for each agent. So it should be of shape (m,n)
adj = 2D np.array of adjacency matrix. Make sure it is symmetric.
quantum = quantum of trade (as in smallest unit which can be traded) 

n1 = market(m,n,ue,endw,adj,quantum)

Example.

m = 2
n = 2
ue = np.array( [ [ 2.0, 1.0 ], [ 1.0, 2.0 ] ] )
endw = np.array( [ [ 1, 2 ] , [ 2, 1 ] ] )
adj = np.array( [ [ 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1 ] ] )
quantum = 0.05

n1 = market(m,n,ue,endw,adj,quantum)
